# VeryMeanBot
A very simple Telegram bot with only one purpose -- to be as mean as possible.
It picks a random insult from a list of insults and just attacks random people from time to time.

The bot also allows one to use one of the insults from the list against someone. This is accomplished with the '/insult' command.
The bot operator can also be given suggestions of creative insults using the '/suggest' command.

This code depends on my Telegram Bot API wrapper [tgbot](https://github.com/vmednis/tgbot).

The version of source posted on the GitHub is stripped of all the profanity. I don't think it is necessary in context of code sharing website.

If you wish to see the bot working I am currently hosting an instance of it.
